Desktop UI for spotify (work in progress)
## Installing on Local Machine
* you must install  node `12.8.0` (the one with hooks, also specified in `.nvmrc`)
* install the packages (`yarn install` or `npm install`)
## Running the Server
* just run `node server.js` in the appropriate directory, and you're set
* please note that this only works currently on a local machine, as I haven't added an additional redirect url to authorize `localhost:8080`
